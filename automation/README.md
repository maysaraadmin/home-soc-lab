# 🤖 SOC Automation Framework

This directory contains automation scripts, playbooks, and infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations for managing and orchestrating the SOC environment.

## 🧩 Components

### 1. Ansible Playbooks
- **Purpose**: Configuration management and deployment automation
- **Features**:
  - Automated deployment of SOC components
  - Configuration management across environments
  - Pre- and post-deployment validation
  - Security hardening automation

### 2. Terraform Configurations
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Features**:
  - Cloud and on-premises infrastructure provisioning
  - Environment consistency
  - Version-controlled infrastructure changes
  - Multi-cloud deployment support

### 3. Utility Scripts
- **Purpose**: Common automation tasks
- **Features**:
  - Backup and restore operations
  - Log rotation and cleanup
  - System health checks
  - Certificate management

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Ansible 2.10+
- Terraform 1.0+
- AWS/Azure/GCP CLI (if using cloud providers)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Running Ansible Playbooks
```bash
# Deploy all SOC components
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/site.yml

# Run specific role
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production playbooks/security_hardening.yml
```

### Applying Terraform Configurations
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
cd terraform/environments/production
terraform init

# Plan and apply changes
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Store sensitive data in a secure vault (e.g., Ansible Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
- Use least privilege principles for all automation accounts
- Regularly rotate credentials and API keys
- Audit all automation code before execution in production

## 🧪 Testing

### Linting
```bash
# Ansible linting
ansible-lint

# Terraform linting
tflint
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```
