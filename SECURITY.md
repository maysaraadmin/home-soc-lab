# Security Best Practices for SOC Environment

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the SOC environment and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure configuration.

## Secrets Management

### Docker Secrets

All sensitive data is managed using Docker secrets, which provides the following benefits:
- Secrets are stored in memory and never written to disk unencrypted
- Access to secrets is restricted to authorized services
- Secrets are encrypted during transit

### Secret Files Location

Secret files are stored in the `docker/secrets` directory with restricted permissions (600). This directory is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.

### Regenerating Secrets

To regenerate all secrets, run:

```powershell
.\generate-secrets.ps1
```

This will create new random values for all secrets. **Note**: This will invalidate all existing sessions and require service restarts.

## Network Security

- **Network Segmentation**: Services are organized into separate Docker networks:
  - `soc_network`: Main communication network
  - `soc_internal`: Internal-only services (no external access)
  - `soc_monitoring`: Monitoring services
  - `soc_storage`: Storage backend services

- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure your host firewall is configured to allow only necessary ports.

## Service Hardening

### Elasticsearch
- X-Pack security enabled
- Authentication required for all operations
- Transport layer security (TLS) recommended for production

### PostgreSQL
- Password authentication required
- Connections restricted to Docker internal network
- Regular backups recommended

### Cassandra
- Authentication enabled
- Role-based access control (RBAC) configured
- Regular compaction and repair scheduled

## Monitoring and Logging

- All services log to standard output/error
- Consider implementing centralized logging with log rotation
- Monitor for failed login attempts and unusual access patterns

## Backup and Recovery

Regularly back up:
- Database volumes
- Configuration files
- Secret files (securely encrypted)

## Incident Response

1. **Detect**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected services
3. **Eradicate**: Remove threats and patch vulnerabilities
4. **Recover**: Restore services from clean backups
5. **Review**: Analyze the incident and update security measures

## Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security vulnerabilities to your security team immediately.
